# Analyse-NFL-Stats

In this NFL case study, to predict the outcome of NFL games, a
machine learning model was made. To get there, visualisation of key
game stats like offensive passing yards, defensive yards allowed,
passing attempts, turnovers and results, was required. The logistic
regression machine learning technique was best suited to binary
classification problems such as this. To evaluate the performance,
tuning the modelâ€™s hyperparameters was necessary, to see the best
model accuracy. From this model performance, it is evident that we
can predict wins and losses with good accuracy (88.8%), sensitivity
(89.3%) and specificity (86.8%).
